6. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript?

7. What's a callback function and what are some reasons when we use/need callback functions?
  A callback is a function to be executed after another function is executed. For example, if you have a function a running then function b, function a could take longer to load which would make function b run first. You can use a callback to ensure function a runs first before function b is executed.

8. What's the biggest difference between a promise and a callback?
  A promise is either pending, fulfilled, or rejected. After being created if fulfilled, it will do a .then(on-fullfillment) and return the promise. If rejected, it will go to a .then/.catch and then return.
